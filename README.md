# About

📚 This repository was created to document the code from the "Let's Make Games" tutorial series:
[Let's Make Games Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx)

👏 All the credits go to the original author. I created this repository to make it easier for others to follow along step by step with the tutorial, as the author didn't share the code divided into episodes.

## Notes

📌 Every episode has its own commit, except for the first two setup episodes.
🔢 Every commit is numbered and includes the episode title in the description.

💻 This repository was created using CLion on macOS  and the libraries i installed in the standard location (/library/templates). If you use another IDE on a different system, you may need to make changes in the CMake file.
